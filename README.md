# Algorithm-Visualizer-
A program to visualize sorting algorithms made using Python and the Tkinter library

The program allows the user to select a sorting algorithm from a drop-down menu and uses text file to select data to be sorted using the selected algorithm. The
sorting process is animated on the screen, and the user can adjust the speed of the animation using a slider. The program also provides a button to stop the sorting process if it is running. We have also
implemented a window that shows the space and time complexities for each algorithm. The aim of the program is to provide a visual representation of the different sorting algorithms, making it easier for
users to understand their inner workings and compare their performance.
